# dotfiles

Just personal dotfiles. No plans to make it easily reusable, configurable, extendable or adjustable for a wide audience.

🚧🚧🚧 Work in progress <br/>
🚧🚧🚧 Far from perfection 😂

## TODO

Set up installation / configuration / backup and restore for:

- ✔️ CLI tools and GUI apps via Homebrew
- ✔️ VS Code extensions
- ZSH and iTerm
- Dotfiles themselves
- OS X settings
- Secrets
- Application settings via [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup)
